# GitHub-Issue-Forecasting-on-GCP
This project tracks and visualizes GitHub issues for selected repositories over the past year. It uses a React frontend to display historical data and forecasted trends generated by a Flask + LSTM backend. All services are deployed on Google Cloud Platform, with forecast graphs stored and served from Cloud Storage, making it a cloud-native, microservices-based analytics tool.
